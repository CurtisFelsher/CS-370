Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was provided a foundation of code for a maze game where an intelligent agent (pirate) navigates a maze to find a treasure utilizing deep Q-learning. The initial code included the maze layout, methods employed by the agent to visualize the maze, and initial game configurations. I was tasked with completing the 'qtrain' function which is the drving force behing the training process used by the agent. I was tasked with changing around exploration factor parameters to find which suited the model best, initialization of the experience replay mechanism, and the main training loop where the agent interacts with the maze, develops expereiences, and updates future policies based on the rewards received and Q-value predictions. 


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Coputer scientists within the AI space desisgn and analyze algorithms to solve problems. They also study the performance of computer software and hardware. Computer scientists tend to push the boundaries of waht technology is able to achieve. Their work is crucial in driving innovation, improving efficiency within the computer science space, aiding in scientific research, and providing tools in the form of software that enchance aspects of our everyday lives. 


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, i like to take a systematic and highly organized approach. I first start with identifying the problem at hand and doing research on the matter as to better understand core concepts of the problem. The more knowledge that is gained, the better and more efficient the process can become. I then proceed to the design phase where I start on the methods used to solve the problem. Next comes the implmentation of my design by converting the design into executable code. After development of the intial code is complete, testing can begin to squash bugs. Once all bugs and issues are solved, optimation takes place to ensure application stability. Once the program has been fully optimized, the development process can be documented and shared to help uplift peers within the space. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists have many eithical responsibilities that they should follow. Privacy and data security should be the number one priority as leaks can cause irrersible damage to individuals or companys. Accuracy and fairness are highly sought after within the AI space as algorithms should mitigate biases and promote fairness within the model. Transparency is another key pillar to stand upon as explaining how all data is used is crucial in this day and age. Integrity should also be pursued as tools created by computer scientists can cause havoc and computer scientists should only create software that better society as a whole. Our software should never be used for malicious purposes.
